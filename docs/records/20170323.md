- Added headers to track lists.
- Wrote production README.
- Fell down a very, very deep rabbit-hole involving waveforms.
* Waveforms use the Web Audio API. This is a much more complicated API than what I had been dealing with.
* Many Javascript libraries are not compatible with React. If someone made a React wrapper, it's often poorly maintained.
* That being said, I was able to get a waveform working on the wavesurfer branch.
* One issue - the audio tag that actually plays the music lives in the Audio component, while I want the waveform to be in the TrackDetails component. How will they talk to each other? Will dispatching actions lead to performance issues?
