- Created custom volume component using rc-slider component.
* Can click volume icon to mute/unmute.
* Can drag slider to adjust volume.
- Progress bar now skips to mouse location if clicked.
- Added uploading modal to prevent users from navigating away or taking other actions while uploading.
- Redirection from upload screen now works correctly.
* There were race conditions (trying to load the TracksIndexItem before the imageUrl is saved) that I handled with promises and null checks.
- Added VERY basic song details screen and links to it.
* There are known issues with it. Most seriously, it does not persist with reload because it's looking at state.tracksInfo rather than doing an AJAX query to the backend.
* I need to add a dispatch action to the container.
